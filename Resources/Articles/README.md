📃 **[Enhancing Trading Performance Through Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09739)**  
This study integrates real‑time sentiment analysis using GPT‑2 and FinBERT with traditional technical indicators (like MACD, SAR, VW MACD) and time‑series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, ETS) to enhance trading strategies on the S&P 500. The combined sentiment‑driven and technical approach significantly outperforms a benchmark buy‑and‑hold strategy—delivering the top return of ~5.77%—and demonstrates more adaptive performance in volatile markets.

This paper titled _“RANDOM STRATEGY VERSUS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS STRATEGY: THE CASE OF EUR/USD INTRADAY TRADING”_ by Svoboda & Sponerová compares a simple moving-average–based technical analysis strategy (with a 3:1 risk‑reward ratio) against a timing‑based random entry strategy across three years of EUR/USD intraday data, and finds that the random‑timed approach may perform comparably—or even better—than the technical‑analysis strategy under those conditions
